Linking arc4nix statically or dynamically with other modules is making a combined work based on arc4nix. Thus, the terms and conditions of the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders of arc4nix give you permission to combine [name of your program] with free software programs or libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with code included in the standard release of ESRI licensed software under the your ESRI agreements (or modified versions of such code, with unchanged license). You may copy and distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for arc4nix and the licenses of the other code concerned{, provided that you include the source code of that other code when and as the GNU GPL requires distribution of source code}.

Note that people who make modified versions of arc4nix are not obligated to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is their choice whether to do so. The GNU General Public License gives permission to release a modified version without this exception; this exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which carries forward this exception.
